* in array index always start from Zero,in each block 4 bytes will be there
* so if we create 10 blocks then 40 bytes will be there continuously
*int[]arr1=new int[10];   syntax of arrya logical coding
*array demands 40 bytes cintinously  for above array creation
*for one block we store 4 bytes 






1.write a java program to create an integer array with 10 location store 35 in the first location also display the elements?

2.write a java program to create byte array with 5 location accept two numbers from the user and store 1st number in the 2nd position and 2nd number in the 3rd position add both numbers and display the sum

3. define an integer array with 10 blocks. store 25 in the first position and store 45 in the 4th position and display those elements

4. define an integer array with 5 blocks. store 27 in the last location and display the same 

5.Define an integer array with 10 blocks. Store 200 in the last location and store 34 in the last but one location and display both the elements

6. Define an integer array with 11 location store 37 in the middle location and display the same

7. Create an integer array with 14 locations, store 41 in the mid position.store 76 in the mid 3-position.store 65 in the mid+2 position and display all the elements.Also find the sum of all those elements and display the result

8. Initialize a string array hich contains 5 city names. Display only third city by adding prefix "Welcome to" 

9. Create a byte array with 6 blocks.Store any number between -128 to +128 in the mid+1 position. Assign the element by creating an integer array with 7 blocks and store the element in the mid-1 position.Display both the elements.

10. Create an integer an array with 4 blocks store any number between 70 to 110 in the last position. Assign that element by creating a character array with 3 blocks and store the element in first position.Display both elements.
